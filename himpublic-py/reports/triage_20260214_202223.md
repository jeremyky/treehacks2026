## 1) Chief Complaint (Victim's words)

---

## 2) Mechanism / Context

Debris impact; possible entrapment. Bleeding reported. Possible fracture/dislocation per victim.

---

## 3) Triage Priority (Speech-first)

**Priority:** URGENT

**Rationale:** Bleeding reported with severe pain or suspected fracture.

---

## 4) Suspected Injuries (ranked differential)

| # | Suspected injury | Likelihood | Evidence: Victim | Vision | Context |
|---|------------------|------------|------------------|--------|---------|
| 1 | External bleeding (laceration/abrasion) | likely | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| 2 | Elbow or limb fracture / dislocation | likely | ✓ | — | ✓ |
| 3 | Open fracture (bone + wound) | possible | ✓ | — | ✓ |
| 4 | Crush syndrome / crush-related complications | possible | ✓ | — | ✓ |

## 5) Do ASAP (robot + victim guidance, minutes)

- Call for human responders immediately; transmit location and report possible major bleed + suspected fracture if applicable.
- Control bleeding: instruct victim to apply firm direct pressure with cloth/dressing; keep pressure continuous.
- If bleeding is life-threatening and equipment available: tourniquet above wound, not on a joint (responder guidance).
- Immobilize suspected fracture: minimize movement; support with sling/splint if available.
- Screen red flags: 'Is bleeding soaking through in under a minute or spurting?' (upgrade to Immediate if yes).
- Screen: 'Can you wiggle fingers? Any numbness or tingling?' (vascular/nerve risk).
- Screen: 'Any trouble breathing, chest pain, or feeling faint?' (shock/airway).
- Shock prevention: keep victim warm, reassure, keep still.

---

## 6) For Responders on Arrival

- Hemorrhage control: hemostatic dressing, pressure bandage, tourniquet if indicated.
- Neurovascular exam of limb: pulses, cap refill, sensation, motor function.
- Immobilization + analgesia + imaging: splint, pain control, X-ray, ortho evaluation.
- Open wound/open fracture precautions: cover wound, infection/tetanus (responders).
- Crush/entrapment: if prolonged compression, plan treatment around extrication risk; document and warn.

## 7) Visual Evidence (supporting only)

- Possible blood-like or injury cue near elbow (visual-only, possible confidence).
### Evidence gallery

- **elbow:** possible (confidence 0.25) — visual only, not used for severity.
